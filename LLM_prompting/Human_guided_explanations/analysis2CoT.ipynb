Suppose, for example, that Omni-Plex Corporation has its principal place of business in the Northern District of California, sufficient contact to support general in personam jurisdiction over the corporation, that is, jurisdiction for a claim that arises anywhere. Assume further that Omni- Plex has no contacts in any other federal district within California. Under §1391(d), Omni-Plex ‘‘resides’’ in the Northern District of California, because, if the Northern District were a state, its contacts there would be sufficient to support personal jurisdiction over it there. But it would not ‘‘reside’’ in the Eastern District of California. It has no contacts there, so that, if the Eastern District were a state, it would not be subject to personal jurisdiction there. This is confusing because a defendant that is ‘‘at home’’ in a state (Daimler A.G. at 137) is subject to personal jurisdiction anywhere in the state, not just in the part of the state where the contacts exist. But §1391(d) tells us that, for venue purposes, we should look at the contacts in each district within the state separately. The corporation will be deemed to ‘‘reside’’ only in the districts where its contacts would support personal jurisdiction if that district were a state. Here’s a question to illustrate the operation of this vexing provision.\\nQuestion:\\n3. Manufacturing venue. Arthur wishes to bring a diversity action in federal court against Cleveland Manufacturing Company. Cleveland has its factory and principal place of business in the Northern District of Illinois, but no other contacts with Illinois. The claim is based on alleged negligence in making a toaster at the Illinois factory, which caused a fire in Arthur’s home in the Middle District of Georgia.\\nAnswer:\\nThe Southern District of Illinois is not a proper venue under §1391 because no events giving rise to the claim took place there and Cleveland does not reside there under the venue statute.\\nAnalysis:\\nSo, C is the right answer. The Southern District of Illinois is not a proper venue.\"\n",

It relies on §1391(b)(2), which provides that venue is proper in a district where a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim took place. But again, under §1391(b)(2) we have to focus on the district where the events took place, not the state.
