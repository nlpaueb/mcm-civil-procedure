This section clarifies where a case may be brought; either the district where all defendants reside or where a significant portion of the events related to the claim occurred. However, defining where a corporation resides can be complex. Sections 28 U.S.C. §1391(c)(2) and (d) deal with this issue. It defines the residence of a corporation as any judicial district where it is under the court's personal jurisdiction concerning a particular civil action. If a state has more than one judicial district, a corporation is deemed to reside in any district within the state where it has sufficient contacts to be subjected to personal jurisdiction. If there is no such district, the corporation is considered to reside in the district with which it has the most significant contacts. An example is provided, using a fictional corporation and a legal dispute. Multiple potential district venues are considered, shedding light on the application of the provisions.\\n\\nQuestion:\\nChu, a Californian, went skiing at Aspen, in Colorado, which has only one federal judicial district. After he discovered that he was somewhat out of shape, he bought an exercise machine from Jackson, a friend from Kansas with a two-week time share in Aspen, who had brought the machine with him to Aspen after buying it in Texas. The machine was made by Sweda- Trak, a Texas company that sells its products only in Texas, and with its only place of business in the Western District of Texas. Chu brought the machine back to Los Angeles, California, where he was injured using it. Chu brings a diversity action against Jackson and Sweda-Trak in federal court, alleging that Jackson was negligent in maintaining the machine, and Sweda-Trak in designing it. Venue in Chu’s action would be\\n\\nAnswer:\\nproper in the Southern District of California under §1391(b)(2), because a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim took place there.\"\n",
