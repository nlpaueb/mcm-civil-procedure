This section clarifies where a case may be brought; either the district where all defendants reside or where a significant portion of the events related to the claim occurred. However, defining where a corporation resides can be complex. Sections 28 U.S.C. ยง1391(c)(2) and (d) deal with this issue. It defines the residence of a corporation as any judicial district where it is under the court's personal jurisdiction concerning a particular civil action. If a state has more than one judicial district, a corporation is deemed to reside in any district within the state where it has sufficient contacts to be subjected to personal jurisdiction. If there is no such district, the corporation is considered to reside in the district with which it has the most significant contacts. An example is provided, using a fictional corporation and a legal dispute. Multiple potential district venues are considered, shedding light on the application of the provisions.\\n\\nConcept:\\nVenue in Civil Procedure\\n\\nBackground:\\nMark, a resident of Florida, wants to file a personal injury lawsuit against GreenCo, a multinational corporation headquartered in Delaware, for injuries sustained due to a defective product. The product was purchased online and delivered to Mark's home in Florida. Mark believes the defective product was manufactured and designed at GreenCo's facility in Kansas.\\n\\nQuestion:\\nIn which district would venue be proper if Mark brings a personal injury lawsuit against GreenCo in federal court?\\n\\nChoices:\\nA) The District of Delaware, where GreenCo is headquartered\\nB) The Middle District of Florida, where Mark resides\\nC) The District of Kansas, where the defective product was manufactured and designed\\nD) The Southern District of Florida, where the product was delivered to Mark's home\"\n",

Therefore, a significant portion of the events related to the claim occurred there.\\n\\nC) The District of Kansas, where the defective product was manufactured and designed\\n Incorrect, although the product was manufactured and designed in Kansas, the significant harm occurred in Florida, making this district less relevant for this case.\\n\\nD) The Southern District of Florida, where the product was delivered to Mark's home\\n Incorrect, because Mark does not reside in the Southern District of Florida and no specific information was given that suggest the Southern District as the proper venue.\"\n",
