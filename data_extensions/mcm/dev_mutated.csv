1110052,"Henry filed a lawsuit in federal court against Jenny under a federal law and lost the case. The federal court determined that Jenny was not liable under the federal law. Later, Henry filed a lawsuit in a state court against Jenny for the same incident but under a different state law, which was not brought up in the initial federal court case. Based on the concept of claim preclusion, will Henry's second lawsuit in the state court be allowed?","Yes, because it is a different law and was not previously brought up in the federal court case.",0,"Incorrect, because claim preclusion doesn't only apply to the same legal theories, but also to the same transaction or occurrence.
